# TikTok-Claims-Classification
This is a capstone project useful for completing the course: **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. 

**Performed:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Visualization, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Understand the business scenario and problem
TikTok users can report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

**My goals:**
- Model building for the claims classification project within TikTok's data team. 
- Evaluate the performance of the developed model through appropriate metrics and techniques. 
- Summarize the findings and insights derived from the model for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok.
